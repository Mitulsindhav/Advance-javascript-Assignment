  <body>
    <h3>Q.1.What is promises</h3>
    <p>
      In the context of programming, particularly in JavaScript, a promise is an
      object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an
      asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
    </p>
  
    <p> Objective :To understand how to use promises in JavaScript.</p>
   
    <p>Rejected: The operation failed.</p>

    <p>Prerequisites: A reasonable understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, including event handling.</p>
   
    <p>States: A promise can be in one of three states:</p>
    
    <p>Fulfilled: The operation completed successfully.</p>
    
    <p>Pending: The initial state; the operation is still ongoing.</p>

    <script>
     
        function part1(par1) {
        console.log(par1);
      }

      let MyPromise = new Promise((successfully, Failed) => {
        if (!successfully) {
          return successfully("successfully");
        } else {
          return Failed("Failed");
        }
      });
      MyPromise.then(
        (a) => {
          part1(a);
        },
        (b) => {

          part1(b);
        }
      );
    </script>
  </body>
