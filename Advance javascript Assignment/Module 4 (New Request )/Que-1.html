    <h2>Q.1.What is JSON</h2>
    <p> JSON, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation, is a lightweight data-interchange  format that's easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines  to parse and generate. Itâ€™s commonly used to transmit data between a server  and a web application as text. JSON is language-independent but is often used with JavaScript.</p>
